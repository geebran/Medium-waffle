                    Have you invented something so cool, useful and original that the rest of the world just shouldn’t be forced to live without it any longer? Unless you want to make others rich on the avails of your ingenuity, you’re probably going to want to patent that.

                    (Note: if it’s a business name you’re talking about, you’re actually after a trademark. You can’t patent a book, a play or a song, either — that’s copyright).

                <p>
                    For the uninitiated: a patent is a type of monopoly the government grants inventors for a set period of time, giving the inventor the exclusive right to manufacture, sell, use or otherwise benefit from. Basically, it ensures that no one else can steal
                    your unique design/idea.

                    Well, unless you’re a patent troll. In that case, you make a career of buying patents and threatening inventors and companies with lawsuits. That’s a whole article unto itself, so I’ll just let John Oliver explain patent trolls in the way only he can
                    (with clips from <a href="#">Shark Tank</a>):

                <p>
                    Even if you work with a patent attorney, this is your baby, and you should get as familiar with the process as possible.

                <h1 class="heading">How to File a Patent in X Steps</h1>

                <p><strong>1. Search the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</strong> Before you invest another dollar or minute of your time, <a href="#">use this search engine</a> to make sure your idea hasn’t already been patented. Make sure your
                    idea is something you can patent using <a href="#">this resource from the USPTO</a>.
                </p>

                <p><strong>2. Find a patent attorney.</strong> The application process can be made much simpler with the assistance of an experienced attorney, who can also help you avoid mistakes that could prove costly later on. Stephen Key has a <a href="#">great resource here on what to look for in a patent
                    attorney</a>.
                </p>

                <p><strong>3. Determine what type of patent you need.</strong> Do you need a Utility, Design, or Plant patent? This will <a href="#">guide the process you’ll use</a> to apply for the patent.</p>
